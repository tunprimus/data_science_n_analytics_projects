In this challenge you must analyse demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:

|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |

|  1 |    50 | Self-emp-not-inc |    83311 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial   | Husband        | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               13 | United-States    | <=50K    |

You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:

-   How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (`race` column)
-   What is the average age of men?
-   What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
-   What percentage of people with advanced education (`Bachelors`, `Masters`, or `Doctorate`) make more than 50K?
-   What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
-   What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
-   What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
-   What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
-   Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

Use the starter code in the file `demographic_data_analyzer.py`. Update the code so all variables set to `None` are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.
